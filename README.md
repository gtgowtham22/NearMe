    The Presiding Deity of this Temple is Lord Hanuman who Blesses His Devotees as Veera Anjanayer. This Temple is built in Kakkalur village in Thiruvallur District. Though the Temple is quite simple and compact the power of this God is immense and hence there is a steady flow of Devotees not only from Thiruvallur District but from the neighboring Chennai City, Kanceepuram and Chengalpet Districts too. There is a continious chanting of Rama Naamam in this Temple. There are quite a few shops selling flowers, garlands and other divine Pooja Items. There is a Sub Shrine for Lord Vinayaka too.</font>
